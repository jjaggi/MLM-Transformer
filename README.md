# Transformer-based Masked Language Model & Hangman Solver

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This repo dives into **transformer architectures** applied to a character-level masked language task and pairs it with a strategic Hangman solver:

1. **Transformer-based Masked Language Model (MLM)** â€“ Custom tokenizers, multi-head attention, and positional embeddings trained on millions of masked sequences.
2. **Heuristic Hangman Solver** â€“ A light-weight complement using entropy and suffix cues to guess words under limited attempts.

Most of the work focuses on understanding and tuning the transformerâ€”how it learns patterns in character sequencesâ€”while the Hangman solver demonstrates a practical use of those insights.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- Visualized multi-head **self-attention** to inspect character dependencies.
- Designed a **character tokenizer** with learnable positional embeddings.
- Trained on a **3â€¯GB masked corpus** with mixed-precision and gradient accumulation.
- Analyzed **loss curves**, **accuracy**, and **perplexity** to fine-tune hyperparameters.
- Explored **model variations** (layer depth, head count).
- Applied **learning-rate warmup**, **cosine decay**, **weight decay**, and **gradient clipping**.
